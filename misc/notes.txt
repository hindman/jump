NAME

    nameit - Associate a frequently used string with a short name
    j      - Jump to a named path (cd to it)
    e      - Echo a named string

SYNOPSIS

    nameit --add NAME STRING [--literal] # Add a named path or literal string
    nameit --rm NAME                     # Delete a named string
    nameit --mv OLD_NAME NEW_NAME        # Change name of a string

    nameit NAME                          # Print a named string
    nameit                               # List all named strings

    nameit --help                        # Print help and exit

    j NAME
    e NAME

DESCRIPTION

    The nameit utility can be used to assign convenient names to frequently
    used strings, typically paths.

    The related j and e shell commands can then be used to cd to a named path
    or to echo a named string (the latter when constructing larger shell
    commands via command interpolation).

    A simple example:

        nameit docs $HOME/my/favorite/docs
        nameit words /usr/share/dict/words

        j docs
        grep ^aa `e words` > words_starting_with_aa

    The nameit utility will add paths in their normalized, absolute form and
    will handle common shell conventions (., .., and ~). Use the --literal
    option to bypass the default path normalization.

    Named paths are stored in .nameitrc in the user's home directory.

INSTALLATION

    Download the nameit script to a directory in your PATH and make it
    executable.

    Add the following commands to your Bash profile (adjust the value assigned
    to NAME_SCRIPT as needed):

        NAME_SCRIPT="$HOME/bin/nameit"
        function j { cd $("$NAME_SCRIPT" "$1") }
        function e { "$NAME_SCRIPT" "$1" }
