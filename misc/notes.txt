NAME

    namepath - Associate a frequently used path with a short name
    j        - Jump to a named path (cd to it)
    e        - Echo a named path

SYNOPSIS

    namepath
    namepath --add NAME PATH
    namepath --rm NAME
    namepath --mv OLD_NAME NEW_NAME
    namepath --help

    j NAME
    e NAME

DESCRIPTION

    The namepath utility can be used to assign convenient names to frequently
    used paths.

    The related j and e commands can then be used to cd to a named path or to
    echo a named path (the latter when constructing larger shell commands via
    command interpolation).

    A simple example:

        namepath docs $HOME/my/favorite/docs
        namepath words /usr/share/dict/words

        j docs
        grep ^aa `e words` > words_starting_with_aa

    Named paths are stored in $HOME/.namepathrc.

INSTALLATION

    Download the namepath script to a directory in your PATH and make it
    executable.

    Add the following commands to your Bash profile (adjust the value assigned
    to NAME_SCRIPT as needed):

        NAME_SCRIPT="$HOME/bin/namepath"
        function j { cd $("$NAME_SCRIPT" "$1") }
        function e { "$NAME_SCRIPT" "$1" }
